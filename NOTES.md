## Templates, Views, URLs

* URLs control the entry point (where)
* Views control the logic (what)
* Templates contain the HTML

* the order in which you create them does not matter
* all 3 are required

## Templates

* create a base.html for content that is repeated on every page
* template blocks can be overwritten by child templates via inheritance

## Tests

* tests let us write how we expect a specific piece of our project to behave
* tests help us confirm that code works as expected
